# hello-world

Hello World, my name is Claudio Daniel and I'm a PhD student in Brazil. 
My PhD project will focus on the intertwining between Complex Networks and Machine Learning.
I'm also interested in studying Data Science as well.
I have experience in Optimization of Dynamical Systems, such as Biological Reaction-Diffusion Networks, which I've used a Genetic Algorithm to fit Biophysical models to experimental data.

Welcome to my repository, and be my guest!
